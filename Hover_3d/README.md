# 3D Hover Cards

This project demonstrates a 3D card hover effect using HTML and CSS. Each card contains images and has an interactive hover effect that transforms the card, revealing more content.

## Features

- **3D Hover Effect:** When hovering over each card, it rotates and displays additional elements.
- **Responsive Design:** The card sizes are flexible and adjust according to the screen size.
- **Smooth Transitions:** All animations and transitions are smooth and responsive.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the 3D card hover effect in action.
3. Ensure the images are in the appropriate folder (`Images/`).

## Future Enhancements

- **Add More Cards:** More themed cards will be added, each with its own unique hover effects.
- **Navigation Bar:** A navigation bar will be added to filter and adjust the display of cards according to their type.
- **Background Music:** Add background music that plays when hovering over a particular card, tailored to each card's theme.

## Files Included

- `index.html` - The main HTML file.
- `style.css` - The stylesheet for the layout and animations.
- `Images/` - Folder containing images used in the cards.
