IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (SBI) is a robust platform designed for integrating complex B2B processes across various systems and partners. A key component of SBI is its use of services and adapters to facilitate seamless data exchange and process automation.

### Introduction

In SBI, **services** are configurable resources that perform specific activities within a business process, such as data transformation or routing. **Adapters**, a specialized type of service, enable communication between SBI and external systems, handling protocols like FTP, HTTP, or database interactions. They can initiate business processes or be invoked during process execution . ([About Services and Adapters - IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/b2b-integrator/6.2.0?topic=adapters-about-services&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Services and Adapters - IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/b2b-integrator/6.1.1?topic=integrator-services-adapters&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

### Purpose

The primary purpose of adapters in SBI is to provide non-invasive integration with external applications and systems. They facilitate tasks such as: ([[PDF] Sterling Integrator: Managing Services and Adapters - IBM](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/commerce/doc/sb2bi/si51/SI51_ManagingServicesAdapters.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[PDF] End-to-end Integration with IBM Sterling B2B ... - IBM Redbooks](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247992.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- Exchanging data with ERP, CRM, and legacy systems
- Handling various communication protocols (e.g., FTP, HTTP, MQ)
- Managing data formats and enveloping EDI transactions
- Interfacing with databases and queuing solutions ([Sterling B2B Integrator Services and Adapters - IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/b2b-integrator/6.2.0?topic=integrator-sterling-b2b-services-adapters&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [[PDF] Sterling Integrator: Managing Services and Adapters - IBM](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/commerce/doc/sb2bi/si51/SI51_ManagingServicesAdapters.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

This modular approach allows organizations to build flexible and scalable integration solutions .

# MFT/GIS Patching from Sterling Integrator

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the process for applying patches to the Managed File Transfer (MFT) / Global Integration Services (GIS) environment managed through IBM Sterling Integrator. Regular patching ensures security, stability, and performance enhancements are maintained within the platform.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a step-by-step guide to properly apply patches to the Sterling Integrator environment, minimizing downtime and ensuring system integrity.

## 3. Scope
This procedure applies to all environments where Sterling Integrator is deployed, including development, test, staging, and production. It covers the patching of application binaries, configuration updates, and associated system components critical to MFT/GIS operations.

## 4. Target Audience
- System Administrators
- MFT/GIS Support Engineers
- IT Operations Teams
- Middleware Administrators

## 5. Prerequisites
- Access to Sterling Integrator application servers.
- Valid and tested backup of the Sterling Integrator environment (application, database, configuration files).
- Patch files obtained from IBM Support or Sterlingâ€™s official patch distribution.
- Review of patch documentation and release notes.
- Downtime approval (for production environments).
- Rollback plan in case of patch failure.

## 6. Work Instructions

### 6.1 Preparation
- Verify the environment and version compatibility with the patch.
- Notify all stakeholders about the scheduled maintenance window.
- Stop new file transfers and integration processes where feasible.
- Take full backups (application directories, database snapshots).

### 6.2 Applying the Patch
- Log into the server where Sterling Integrator is installed.
- Stop Sterling Integrator services:
  ```
  stopSI.sh (Unix/Linux) or stopSI.cmd (Windows)
  ```
- Navigate to the directory where the patch files are located.
- Apply the patch using the appropriate patch script or manually replace files according to patch instructions.
- Update any configuration files as required by the patch notes.
- Clear cache directories if recommended.

### 6.3 Post-Patching Steps
- Start Sterling Integrator services:
  ```
  startSI.sh (Unix/Linux) or startSI.cmd (Windows)
  ```
- Validate system startup without errors.
- Perform functional and regression testing to confirm that integrations, file transfers, and user interfaces are operational.
- Monitor logs (`noapp.log`, `app.log`, etc.) for any abnormalities.

### 6.4 Rollback Plan (If Required)
- If errors are detected that cannot be resolved promptly, stop services.
- Restore the backup taken before patching.
- Restart services and verify normal operations.
